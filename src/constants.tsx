    question: "What is Product Testing?",
    answer: (
      <p className={faqClassName}>
        Product testing is the process of evaluating a productâ€™s quality,
        functionality, usability, and overall performance before it is released
        to the market. Product testing can be done through a variety of methods,
        such as user testing, focus groups, surveys, and more. The goal of
        product testing is to gather feedback and insights from real users to
        identify and address any issues or flaws in the product, as well as to
        make data-driven decisions to improve the productâ€™s overall quality and
        user experience.

            interact with products and identify areas for improvement.
          </li>
          <li>
